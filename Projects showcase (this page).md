<!-- At some point, I realized that the page you are currently looking at is a project in itself.

It has evolved in several ways:
- Initially a **single-(HTML) file**-contains-all, it has split into more and more / smaller and smaller files over time.
Wanting to edit the project descriptions separately from the page layout itself, I first moved all project data into a JSON file -- and then realized that JSON is not very well-suited for the prose I was writing (some of which you are reading right now). As a result, I moved that data further into separate Markdown files (one for each project).
details:
here the JSON data file used by this page.
https://github.com/tuejoshua/tuejoshua.github.io/blob/main/projects.html
and here is a sample Markdown file:
https://github.com/tuejoshua/tuejoshua.github.io/blob/main/Hilchot Brachot games.md
- initially, I had the site **hosted** in a free web hotel* that supports dynamic pages like the PHP pages I have (but which I did not want to pay for HTTPS),
I then moved everything to GitHub Pages (for easier integration with my repos which are there anyway) - and lastly I realized that I could use IFRAMEs to 

Besides general front-end choices on visual layout and formatting - LESS IS MORE!!! -, it also became obvious that it would be unmanageable to keep all contents in one single (HTML) file.

; around the time when I moved everything into JSON. However, I was doing escaped HTML tags in that, which was not nice... Markdown... separate files... Future improvement: Footnotes? Also: code formatting (via backticks) doesn't look nice with my current font settings...; when opening new one 1) close other card(s) and/or 2) auto-scroll to that card;

summary:
A note about the AwardSpace domain for hosting PHP? (and non-Git-fitting data?) - on that domain, config redirect to GitHUb Page for 404s? Links/anchors for when project descriptions refer to each other? Make sure all text is selectable (e.g. for copying and translation)?
