As I also wanted links to be as short as possible, I came up with this solution, where I can simply put relevant resource(s) in a folder, include a simple \"index.php\" wrapper file, and then share the link to the folder instead.<p>*) Originally, <mark>the ZMANIM image described elsewhere on this page; where the link actually got a LOT shorter (due to a long file name).</mark>",
