<h2>Licenses</h2>

Above (under Acknowledgements [LINK?])...
the rest...

The source code presented on this (my) website is not accompanied by an explicit license statement.
This is not an oversight; I've decided (after briefly researching the topic of source code licensing) that for now, I won't invest the (significant) effort required for determining the optimal type of license for my use of this website.
<mark>Please be aware that this does NOT mean that the license defaults to Public Domain; the opposite is actually the case</mark> according to the sources I did skim before giving up on making a quick decision on this topic.
If you want to do more with my source code than allowed by default, feel free to contact me :)

<h2>To Do</h2>
- Please be warned: ALL of the above-mentioned projects are in a perpetual state of improvement ;-)<br-->

	<!-- This function writes to the DOM, therefore, it should be placed here towards the end of BODY -->
	<!-- TO DO: Other .js files also as modules? -->
	<!-- Not allowed for modules(!):  onerror="window.alert('ERROR\n[unable to load ' + this.src + ']');" -->
	<script type="module">
		import { displayProjectCards } from './displayProjectCards.js';
		// The following function call must be in this script block, together with
		displayProjectCards("projects.json");
	</script>
