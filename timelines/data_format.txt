The .csv file format is as follows:

Start time      Label               End time        Sources (see sources.txt)
===============                     ===============
Greg.   Hebr.                       Greg.   Hebr.

EXAMPLE:
-003761	0000	Adam            	-002830	0930	Spiro,Artscroll

Entries are interpreted as a range aka. time period if the End time is defined
and as a discreet time point aka. event if not.

If one (or both) Start time is missing, the entry will be ignored for that calendar (and an error pop-up will inform the user)
