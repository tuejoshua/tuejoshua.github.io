(Post)processing of Markdown: for each [link](URL) -> [link ICON](URL), where ICON is the Favicon of the linked-to domain, with ALT TEXT and ToolTip like for the other tech icons...
(This way, I won't(?) have to save copies of icons for ALL the domains(!), e.g. GitHub that I link to)
...here's a snippet of an update for Hilchot Brachot games.md, which is not very readable (and where the image is too large for the surrounding text):
"
(and [here ![GitHub icon](./resources/github-mark%20(from%20github.com_logos).svg "GitHub.
For source and license of this icon, see further down this page")](https://github.com/tuejoshua/tuejoshua.github.io/tree/main/hilchotBrachot) to review the source files).

Complete the Markdown project descriptions, incl.
- commented-out "Learnings: Work in Progress..." for EDF Header Record
- full draft for Projects showcase

externalLink.js:
- make usable for links inside Markdown files also (see https://chatgpt.com/c/68bf0d89-67bc-8325-88d2-f159bf5509f7; compare to https://marked.js.org/ documentation...)
- also: ...right-click > open in new tab should NOT just open the same page (with a "#" suffix)... Can we improve that? (I think not; we've tried in the past...)

index_redirect.html:
No longer used... Delete? Or keep as redirect example?

gallery.php.html + .md file:
Study further -> reuse knowledge for "display contents of folder . php"

Make Markdown file for all projects, then remove fallback code in displayProjectCards.js and corresponding params in JSON file

Projects to be added:
- "ABC" "FrontEnd"
- WIN -> LINUX
- Google Drive sync on Linux
- Årets hjul - as part of "Kotel screen" project?

Hardcoded data alternative for timelines snippet:
"
    // Demo data with multi-chapter ranges
    const rawEvents = [
      { startChapter: 1, startVerse: 1, endChapter: 1, endVerse: 5, content: "Creation of light" },
      { startChapter: 1, startVerse: 6, endChapter: 1, endVerse: 8, content: "Creation of sky" },
      { startChapter: 1, startVerse: 26, endChapter: 2, endVerse: 3, content: "Creation of man and rest" },
      { startChapter: 3, startVerse: 1, endChapter: 3, endVerse: 6, content: "Temptation by the serpent" }
    ];

    // Convert to vis.js items
    const items = new vis.DataSet(
      rawEvents.map((e, i) => ({
        id: i + 1,
        content: e.content,
        start: refToDate(e.startChapter, e.startVerse),
        end: refToDate(e.endChapter, e.endVerse)
      }))
    );

My Favicon(.ico) doesn't look good on darker backgrounds, especially Dark Mode, but also just OOF-tabs/windows...
Furthermore, I understand that other formats (svg?) may be supported now?
