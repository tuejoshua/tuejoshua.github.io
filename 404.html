    Notes on GitHub Pages 404 handling logic
    ========================================

    • This setup works specifically for GitHub Pages (and similarly configured static hosts).
      - GitHub Pages will serve this 404.html file for *any unrecognized URL path*.
      - This includes requests to nonexistent HTML files and folders *without* an index.html.
      - If a folder *does* contain index.html, that file is served instead (normal behavior).

    • The server does not issue a 3xx redirect.
      - It simply serves 404.html as the response *body*, with either a 404 or 200 status.
      - This is sometimes called a "soft 404" when the status is 200.

    • Because the server doesn’t redirect, the browser’s address bar remains unchanged.
      - For example, visiting /kotelScreen.html stays in the bar even though /404.html is shown.

    • The redirect logic in this file is called a "client-side redirect"
		(eventhough it is the server that replaces the contents with 404.html - but does NOT redirect!):
      - It runs entirely in the browser (JavaScript).
      - The client interprets the path and decides whether to redirect.

    • A <meta> redirect (see below) is a very limited form of client-side redirect:
      - It can only redirect to a *fixed*, unconditional URL, and 1:1 - i.e. the "wrong" address needs to exist
      - It cannot examine the requested path or make decisions.
      - It is included below as a commented-out example.

    • 3xx redirects differ in key ways:
      - Sent by the server with a Location header (e.g., 301, 302).
      - The browser immediately follows the new URL and updates the address bar.
      - The user never sees the content of the redirecting page.

    ============================
    Optional META redirect demo
    ============================

    Example of a static META redirect:
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=/kotelScreen/kotelScreen.html">

    ⚠️ Limitations:
    - Redirects *all* unmatched paths to that one URL.
	-- So for specific "path A to path B" redirects, path A - containing this META tag - needs to exist(!)
    - Cannot inspect path or apply per-path logic.
    - Therefore, not suitable here—use JavaScript below instead.
