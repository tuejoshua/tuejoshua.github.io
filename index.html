<h2>Some of my projects</h2>
<!-- I initially thought that SPAN ("inline") would be a proper element for the following, but that didn't work; it seems a better description for SPAN is "inside sentences"...
it seems that the I tag is still not deprecated, so I'll use that instead of STYLE for nostalgia's sake :) -->
<div id='showData'>[ Please wait: Reading data from JSON file... <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;If this message remains in place, it means that my JSON parsing pipeline is broken - or that you're viewing a client-side version of this page ]</div>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
The <b>technology icons</b> used above are the creations of others. Click them to see the source and the license under which I'm using them.<br><br>
<b>Fonts</b> are from <script>linkMacro('dejavu-fonts.github.io');</script>. (I discovered them while admiring <script>linkMacro('fabiensanglard.net');</script>, whose style/layout OR contents alone would make it well worth a visit...)<br><br>
<b><script>linkMacro('en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon', 'Favicon');</script></b> generated via (MS Paint and) <script>linkMacro('favicon.cc');</script>.
<br><br>

<h2>To Do</h2>
- Please be warned: ALL of the above-mentioned projects are in a perpetual state of improvement ;-)<br>
- Apply the externalLink() functionality to the technology icons also<br>
- Reformat the above project descriptions, e.g. by adding a "new ground covered" section for describing what was new for me, perhaps emphasize this via keywords shown on the "title bar"?<br>
- Improve the layout/formatting/fonts/style/etc. of this page. Get inspiration from "minimalist" style such as that of fabiensanglard.net<br>

<h1>A note about licensing</h1>
The source code presented on this (my) website is not accompanied by an explicit license statement.
This is not an oversight; I've decided (after briefly researching the topic of source code licensing) that I for now won't invest the (significant) effort required for determining the optimal type of license for my use of this website.
<mark>Please be aware that this does NOT mean that the license defaults to Public Domain; the opposite is actually the case</mark> according to the sources I did skim before giving up on making a quick decision on this topic.
If you want to do more with my source code than allowed by default, feel free to contact me :)
