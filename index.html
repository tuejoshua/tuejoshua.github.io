<h1>A note about licensing</h1>
The source code presented on this (my) website is not accompanied by an explicit license statement.
This is not an oversight; I've decided (after briefly researching the topic of source code licensing) that I for now won't invest the (significant) effort required for determining the optimal type of license for my use of this website.
<mark>Please be aware that this does NOT mean that the license defaults to Public Domain; the opposite is actually the case</mark> according to the sources I did skim before giving up on making a quick decision on this topic.
If you want to do more with my source code than allowed by default, feel free to contact me :)
