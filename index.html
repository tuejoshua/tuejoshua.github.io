<h2>Some of my projects</h2>
<!-- I initially thought that SPAN ("inline") would be a proper element for the following, but that didn't work; it seems a better description for SPAN is "inside sentences"...
it seems that the I tag is still not deprecated, so I'll use that instead of STYLE for nostalgia's sake :) -->

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
The <b>technology icons</b> used above are the creations of others. Click them to see the source and the license under which I'm using them.<br><br>
<b>Fonts</b> are from <a title="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/" href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="externalLink('https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/');">dejavu-fonts.github.io</a>. (I discovered them while admiring <a title="https://fabiensanglard.net/" href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="externalLink('https://fabiensanglard.net/');">fabiensanglard.net</a>, whose style/layout OR contents alone would make it well worth a visit...)<br><br>
<b><a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon" href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="externalLink('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon');">Favicon</a></b> generated via (Paint and) <a title="https://www.favicon.cc/" href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="externalLink('https://www.favicon.cc/');">favicon.cc</a>
<br><br>

<h2>To Do</h2>
- Please be warned: ALL of the above-mentioned projects are in a perpetual state of improvement ;-)<br>
- Apply the externalLink() functionality to the technology icons also<br>
- consider replacing the hardcoded boilerplate for externalLink() links with a preprocessing macro like a JS function or similar? ...plus, Edge still shows the content of the href parameter also as a tooltip... Probably a security feature that is difficult and/or bad form to get around?
- Reformat the above project descriptions, e.g. by adding a "new ground covered" section for describing what was new for me, perhaps emphasize this via keywords shown on the "title bar"?<br>
- Improve the layout/formatting/fonts/style/etc. of this page. Get inspiration from "minimalist" style such as that of fabiensanglard.net<br>
- Consider adding a check/warning for dead links functionality<br>
- Reconsider Favicon strategy, incl. for subpages

<h1>A note about licensing</h1>
The source code presented on this (my) website is not accompanied by an explicit license statement.
This is not an oversight; I've decided (after briefly researching the topic of source code licensing) that I for now won't invest the (significant) effort required for determining the optimal type of license for my use of this website.
<mark>Please be aware that this does NOT mean that the license defaults to Public Domain; the opposite is actually the case</mark> according to the sources I did skim before giving up on making a quick decision on this topic.
If you want to do more with my source code than allowed by default, feel free to contact me :)
