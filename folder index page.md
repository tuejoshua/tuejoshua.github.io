"motivation": "I wanted to share direct links to images* on my server. However, since my webhost does not allow direct access to image files, I needed an ''in-between'' page for handling that traffic. As I also wanted links to be as short as possible, I came up with this solution, where I can simply put relevant resource(s) in a folder, include a simple ''index.php'' wrapper file, and then share the link to the folder instead.<p>*) Originally, the output image for <a href='#Zmanim_for_Machsike_Hadas,_Copenhagen'>the Zmanim_for_Machsike_Hadas project</a>; where the link actually got a LOT shorter (due to a long file name).",

"summary": "<mark><a href='showFolderContents/iframeTest.html'>A page that</a></mark> lists all contents (i.e. files) of the folder in which the page resides, with links to each file plus other filetype-specific behavior (thumbnails for image files etc.)",

"details": "The bulk of the code is contained by this file (not executable directly, by design):<p style='text-align:right'><mark>showFolderContents.php <a href='showFolderContents/showFolderContents_viewSource.php'>(view source)</a></mark><br>(Running the PHP file itself - click <mark><a href='showFolderContents/showFolderContents.php'>here</a></mark> if you want to try - is not allowed for standard backend security reasons)<p>In every folder for which this functionality is wanted, a simple wrapper file with a few lines of code (see header comment of the ''bulk file'' above) shall be added:<p style='text-align:right'>index.php <mark><a href='http://tuejoshua.atwebpages.com/showFolderContents/index_viewSource.php'>(view source)</a></mark><p>- by naming this file index.php, the page will (depending on your server setup*) be displayed when the URL for the containing folder is requested - which is exactly what we want. <p>Lastly, <mark><a href='hilchotBrachot/resources/foods/'>here</a></mark>'s a working example (a folder with some actual contents, showcasing the capabilities of my folder index page.<p>*) <a href='https://www.thoughtco.com/index-html-page-3466505'>Here</a>'s a nice article about the 'index.html/.php' naming convention (I take no responsibility for dead links etc. ;-)).<br><br>https://github.com/tuejoshua/tuejoshua.github.io/tree/main/showFolderContents",
