I wanted to get deeper into test automation.

WEB test automation seems like a sensible choice, since I already have a lot of pages/code on this site, which would serve fine as the target*.
_*) Due to my medical device development carreer, I'm tempted to call this "design output"_

(I also really want to get back into UNIT CODE automation, but that's for another time/project...)

Of the 2 major players (the other being Selenium) Playwright seems to be "the choice of the future".
Also easier to get into - and with my other coding experience, I don't fear I'm missing out on the less steep learning curve ;)

So, very straightforward to set up, following [the official Playwright for VS Code guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode).

Aha-moment: Having to learn the Validation/accessibility focus over my assumed Verification do.:

...but WHAT to test? "Text strings being present in page headings" like in example.spec.ts...???

=> If I can use this for automation of W3C validation!!!
