<!-- Motivation: -->
At [the Kotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Wall), informative screens displaying the daily [halachic times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zmanim) are hanging. (I've seen several [shuls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue) with a similar setup.)  
Inspired by these, I wanted to create one for my own (home) use, as an automatically updating web page to be shown continuously on a tablet, especially for days like Shabbat and Yom Tov, where I cannot use my smartphone as an alternative.  

This led me on a project with 2 major topics:
1. Finding and learning how to use various APIs (zmanim, of course, but also weather); 
2. Trying to layout the page to maximize screen use and legibility.  

The current result can be seen [here](https://tuejoshua.github.io/kotelScreen/kotelScreen.html);
its code as well as several other test versions can be seen [here (GitHub)](https://github.com/tuejoshua/tuejoshua.github.io/tree/main/kotelScreen).
